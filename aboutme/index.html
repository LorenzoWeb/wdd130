    <p>Hello everyone! I am excited to be a part of this course. I am single, but part of a family of four. I love taking up activities that invite critical thinking.
        I also like to play table tennis. </p>
        <p>I am studying for a bachelors in applied technology and I hope to link that with mechanical engineering in the near future. What I like about BYUI education is its spiritual approach to everything. I also admire the emphasis placed on togetherness or group work in all its courses. I am taking this course because I would like to improve my web designing skills. Also,I believe this skill will insure me with a fall upon employment when the need arises. </p>
    <p>I have been a member from my birth and I like the quote that goes by "that which we persist in doing becomes easier, not that the nature of it changes but, our ability to do it improves." I will stick with First Nephi chapter three verse seven(1Nephi 3:7) that states that for every thing we are commanded to do, there is a way provided to accomplish it</p>
    <p>Thank you!</p>
